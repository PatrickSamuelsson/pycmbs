Detailed installation guide for MPI-M users
===========================================

MPI-M users
----------

For users working at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology, the usage of pyCMBS is straightforward.
Nothing has to be installed! You just need to login into your shell and load the pyCMBS module as follows::

    module load pyCMBS/default

That's it. This sets also automatically the settings for the *PYTHONPATH* and *SEP* environment variables which are needed.

Please check if anything is working like described below_.
