Your first benchmarking
-----------------------

The main input for model benchmarking is model data and observational datasets as well as a user specified configuration. After running the benchmarking, you get a report (PDF format) as well as a lot of figures and statistics which contain usefull information. The benchmarking is based ona  modular approach and allows the user to customize the results by activating and deactivating specific components.

The next steps will guide you through a benchmarking session to get you started.

1. set up a working directory and change to it::

    # set up a working directory somewhere on your machine
    mkdir -p ~/temp/my_first_benchmarking
    cd ~/temp/my_first_benchmarking

2. set up an initial configuration::

    # simply run the pycmbs-benchmarking.py script
    # if properly installed, you should be able to just run it from the console
    pycmbs-benchmarking.py init

This gives you::

    $ ls
    configuration  template.cfg

If you do this for the first time,  then it is recommended that you make
yourself familiar with the content of the *configuration* directory. This contains

* INI files for each variable which specify the plot and processing configuration
* .json files which specify interface routines for data conversion

3. adapt the configuration file (xxx.cfg) to your needs. The configuration file is the center part where you specify

   a) which variables shall be diagnosed
   b) which models shall be analysed

   Details about the configuration file are specified below.

4. Do it!
   Run the benchmarking now by executing::

       pycmbs.py your_config_script.cfg
